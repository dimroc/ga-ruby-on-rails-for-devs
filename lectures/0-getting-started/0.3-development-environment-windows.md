Getting Started on Windows
==========================

The following instructions are heavily inspired from [here](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/).

Install Ssh
-----------

Install [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) and manually start `pageant`. 

Generate a private/public key pair using `puttygen` and load it in `pageant`. 

Set `GIT_SSH=c:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe`. 

Install Git
-----------

Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/download).

Configure your username and email.

    git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

Install Ruby
------------

Download a Ruby installer from [the website](http://rubyonrails.org/download "Download Ruby"). Run it.

Test Ruby
---------

    ruby -e "puts :Hello"

Installing Ruby Development Kit
-------------------------------
	
Install the Ruby Development Kit. This allows you to install various bundles with native extensions. Download it from [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and extract it into a new folder. Run `devkitvars.bat` to setup an environment. 

PostgreSQL
----------

We'll use PostgreSQL with our Rails application. Install from [here](http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

Once installed, be sure to use [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/download/) to create a super user with your Window's username and a blank password (empty string). This will allow Rails applications to use your terminal's credentials instead of the login information in the `database.yml` file (more on this later).

Rest assured, only local users will be able to connect to this postgres instance.

Your local username can be determined by looking in User Accounts in Control Panel.
