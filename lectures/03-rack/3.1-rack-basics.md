Rack Basics
===========

Objective
---------

Understand Rack, an essential component of Rails.

Rack
----

Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. 
It includes basic implementations of request, response, cookies & sessions. And a good number of useful middlewares.

Bundler
-------

Bundler is a package manager that sandboxes an application or library. Libraries are called *gems*. 

Create a *Gemfile* that requires Rack and Mongrel, a web server.

``` ruby
source "http://rubygems.org"

gem "rack", "1.3.5"
gem "mongrel", "1.2.0.pre2"
```

Install bundler with RubyGem.

    $ gem install bundler

Install gems.

    $ bundle install
    Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.

Server
------

A simple Rack server responds to a single HTTP request. The `call` method takes one parameter - an environment that contains information about the HTTP request. The response from the `call` method must be an array of three elements: an HTTP return code, headers and an array of body parts.

``` ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'rack'

class HelloWorld
  def call(env)
    [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, ["Hello Rack!"]]
  end
end

Rack::Handler::Mongrel.run HelloWorld.new, :Port => 9292 # Remember the uppercase 'P'
```

It can be run with ruby.

    $ ruby server.rb

Navigate to [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292/).

Exercise
--------

Build a basic web application on top of Rack that can serve simple HTML files from a subdirectory on the local file system.
