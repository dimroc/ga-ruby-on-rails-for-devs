Refactoring with RSpec
======================

Why Test?
---------

Confidence.

* Test regressions.
* Enable refactoring.

Test First?
-----------

* We use manual testing during development and aren't disciplined enough to write tests last.
* Testable architecture and implementation is cleaner and notably easier to refactor.

Test and Behavior Driven Development
------------------------------------

TDD is not about testing, it's about *design*. The process is often called *Red => Green => Refactor*. 

1. Write failing tests.
2. Implement the feature, making tests pass.
3. Refactor in confidence.

BDD
---

Behavior-driven testing is an effective way of testing that helps developers understand what to test and what not to test, as well as how to do that. It focus on behavior, not on tests.

* Stories: As a *role* I want to *action* so that *business value*.
* Scenarios: Given *initial context* and *additional context* when *event* then *outcome*.

RSpec
-----

[RSpec](http://relishapp.com/rspec) is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers. 

``` ruby
# Unit Test
class DuckTest
  test "quack" do
    assert_true Duck.new.quack
  end
end

# RSpec Scenario
describe Duck
  let(:duck) { Duck.new }
  it "should quack" do
    duck.quack.should be_true
  end
end
```

If quacking were common, we could even write `duck.should_quack`.

``` ruby
describe Duck
  let(:duck) { Duck.new }
  context "in the water" do
    before(:each) do
      duck.swim
    end
    it "should quack" do
      duck.quack.should be_true
    end
  end
end
```

Gemfile
-------

Gems from the test group aren't installed in production.

``` ruby
group :test do
  gem "rspec", "~> 2.7"
  gem "rspec-rails", "~> 2.7"
  gem "rspec-core", "~> 2.7"
  gem "rspec-expectations", "~> 2.7"
  gem "rspec-mocks", "~> 2.7"
end
```

You can also have a `:development` group for your favorite tools.

Spec Helper
-----------

A helper can be included with every spec. It defines RSpec behavior, such as what to do before every test or after the test suite finished.

``` ruby
require 'rubygems'

ENV["RAILS_ENV"] ||= 'test'

require "rails/application"
require File.expand_path("../../config/environment", __FILE__)
require 'rspec/rails'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.mock_with :rspec
  config.expect_with :rspec
  config.after(:all) do
    p "All tests finished."
  end
end
```

A Model Spec
------------

A simple spec can execute model validations and ensure they perform as expected. Create *spec/models/thing_spec.rb*.

``` ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe Thing do
  it "can be created with a name" do
    Thing.new({name: "thing"}).should be_valid
  end
  it "cannot be created without a name" do
    Thing.new.should_not be_valid
  end
end
```

Mock Objects vs. Real Data
--------------------------

Sometimes we'll want to use a real database for our testing instead of relying on mock objects. This means we need a clean copy of the database for every test. There's a gem for that.

``` ruby
gem "database_cleaner"
```

We don't need to re-create a schema every time, just truncate tables. Add the setup into *support/config/database_cleaner.rb*.

``` ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:suite) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
  end
  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean
  end
end
```

Include this file via *spec/spec_helper.rb*.

``` ruby
[ "support/config/*.rb", "support/*.rb" ].each do |path|
  Dir["#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/#{path}"].each do |file|
    require file
  end
end
```

Ensure that you have a schema for tests.

    rake db:test:prepare

Run tests.

    rspec spec

Controller Specs w/ Stubs
-------------------------

The implementation of `Thing.method` may be non-trivial, and we're not trying to test it inside a controller test. We can *stub* the implementation of a method with a trivial one or replace an entire instance of `Thing` by a *mock model*. To define it, we add a `mock_thing` function that takes an optional hash of values to return from well-known functions. By adding a call to `as_null_object` we'll cause the mock model to return `nil` from any other method.

``` ruby
def mock_thing(stubs={})
  @mock_thing ||= mock_model(Thing, stubs).as_null_object
end
```

For the `:index` method we want to ensure that `@things` is assigned the collection of things. Because we're working with a mock object we have to stub the class method `Thing.all` that returns a collection of `Thing` instances.

``` ruby
describe "GET index" do
  it "assigns all things to @things" do
    Thing.stub!(:all).and_return [ mock_thing ]
    get :index
    assigns(:things).should eq [ mock_thing ]
  end
end
```

The test expresses the controller's contract, which is to invoke `Thing.all` and assign the result to `@things`.

Exercise
--------

Implement specs for the remaining methods.

* GET new
* GET edit
* POST create
* PUT update
* DELETE destroy

Controller Specs w/ Fabricators
-------------------------------

Mock objects work well for trivial models. Many Rubyists prefer to use real objects that are written to the database in tests, especially for higher level integration tests. Manufacturing these objects can be done by calling `Thing.create!`, but it doesn't provide good defaults or unique values. A *fabricator* from a gem called [fabrication](https://github.com/paulelliott/fabrication) can do that.

``` ruby
gem "fabrication"
```

Add a fabricator for *Thing* in `spec/fabricators/thing_fabricator.rb`.

``` ruby
Fabricator(:thing) do
  name { Fabricate.sequence(:name) { |i| "Thing Number #{i}" } }
end
```

We can now use a real *Thing* for testing.

``` ruby
describe "PUT update" do
  before(:each) do
    @thing = Fabricate(:thing)
  end
  it "updates thing" do
    put :update, :id => @thing.id.to_s, :thing => { 'name' => 'updated' }
    @thing.reload.name.should == 'updated'
  end
end
```

Exercise
--------

Implement the remainder of the Thing controller tests with a Fabricator.

View Specs
----------

Controller code is not executed in a view spec. Therefore, you must explicitly assign variables that would otherwise be assigned by a controller action. The following spec is `spec/views/things/index.html.haml_spec.rb`.

``` ruby
describe "things/index.html.haml" do
  before(:each) do
    @thing = Fabricate(:thing)
    assign(:things, Thing.all)
  end
  it "renders a list of things" do
    render
    assert_select "tr>td", :text => @thing.name, :count => 1
  end
end
```

Integration Tests
-----------------

While we can test individual components, we also want to ensure that the entire *Thing* feature is working. This can be done with an acceptance test that that is going to execute real user actions with a browser with [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and [selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/).

``` ruby
require 'spec_helper'

feature "Things", :driver => :selenium do
  scenario "are displayed in a table" do
    thing = Fabricate(:thing)
    visit "/things"
    page.should have_css "td", text: thing.name
  end
  scenario "can be destroyed" do
    thing = Fabricate(:thing)
    visit "/things"
    page.evaluate_script('window.confirm = function() { return true; }')
    click_link "Destroy"
    Thing.count.should == 0
  end
end
```

Another way of specifying `:driver => :selenium` is `:js => true`.

Refactor in Confidence
----------------------

Controllers support filters that avoid copy-pasting. This is called *DRYing* a controller. *DRY* stands for *Don't Repeat Yourself*. Now that we have specs that cover the application, we can refactor in confidence. 

``` ruby
class ThingsController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :get_thing, :only => [ :edit, :show, :update, :destroy ]
  def get_thing
    @thing = Thing.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

[Other filters](http://rails.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Filters/ClassMethods.html) include `:after_filter`, `:around_filter`, etc.

Exercise
--------

Modify the application to redirect to a *404 Not Found* page when a user requests a *Thing* that doesn't exist. Exercise your TDD - first, write two failing controller and another failing acceptance test.

Exercise
--------

Extend the application with authentication by using the [devise gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise). Only authenticated users should be able to create, edit and destroy things. Write tests. Deploy the application on Heroku. As a stretch goal, if there're no users in the system the application should prompt you to create one.

RSpec Output
------------

Create *.rspec* 

    --format nested
    --color

You can also try [fuubar](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/fuubar) progress bar. It's prettier when you have a lot of tests.

Spork
-----

You must have noticed that Rails takes a while to load. Rails is a large codebase that is interpreted every time you run `rspec`. Add [spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork) to the `:test` group to avoid reloading Rails every time you run tests.

Add `--drb` to *.rspec* and make changes to *spec/spec_helper.rb*.

``` ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'spork'

Spork.prefork do

  ENV["RAILS_ENV"] ||= 'test'

  require "rails/application"
  require File.expand_path("../../config/environment", __FILE__)
  require 'rspec/rails'

  RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :rspec
    config.expect_with :rspec
    config.after(:all) do
      p "All tests finished."
    end
  end

end

Spork.each_run do

  [ "support/config/*.rb", "support/*.rb" ].each do |path|
    Dir["#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/#{path}"].each do |file|
      require file
    end
  end

end
```
