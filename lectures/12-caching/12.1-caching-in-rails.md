Caching in Rails
================

Caching uses a fast, usually in-memory store, to persist data that takes a long time to retrieve or calculate. Caching identifies data by *key* and usually saves it for a given *duration*.

Page Caching
------------

The *WidgetsController* makes two queries: one for widgets and another for gadgets that belong to each widget.

```
Processing by WidgetsController#index as HTML
  Widget Load (2.2ms)  SELECT "widgets".* FROM "widgets" 
  Gadget Load (0.5ms)  SELECT "gadgets".* FROM "gadgets" WHERE "gadgets"."widget_id" = 1
  Gadget Load (0.5ms)  SELECT "gadgets".* FROM "gadgets" WHERE "gadgets"."widget_id" = 2
  Rendered widgets/index.html.haml within layouts/application (171.0ms)
Completed 200 OK in 195ms (Views: 134.5ms | ActiveRecord: 43.9ms)
```
We can start by caching widgets.

``` ruby
class WidgetsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @widgets = get_cached_widgets
  end

  def get_cached_widgets
    Rails.cache.fetch("widgets", :expires_in => 10.minutes) do
      Widget.all
    end
  end

end
```
Notice the query time in ActiveRecord reduced from 43.9ms to 9.0ms.

```
Processing by WidgetsController#index as HTML
  Gadget Load (8.3ms)  SELECT "gadgets".* FROM "gadgets" WHERE "gadgets"."widget_id" = 1
  Gadget Load (0.7ms)  SELECT "gadgets".* FROM "gadgets" WHERE "gadgets"."widget_id" = 2
  Rendered widgets/index.html.haml within layouts/application (33.9ms)
Completed 200 OK in 49ms (Views: 39.4ms | ActiveRecord: 9.0ms)
```

A similar effect can be accomplished with a `caches_page` helper after enabling *perform_caching* in *environments/development.rb*. This caches the entire page output.

``` ruby
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
```

``` ruby
class WidgetsController < ApplicationController

  caches_page :index

  def index
    @widgets = Widget.all
  end

end
```

Cache Expiration
----------------

Caches can be set to expire.

``` ruby
Rails.cache.fetch("widgets", :expires_in => 10.seconds) do
  Widget.all
end
```

Or can be expired explicitly.

``` ruby
def create
  expire_page :action => :index
end
```

Action Caching
--------------

Caching pages cannot be combined with authentication, because filters are run within the cache block. To cache the output of an action, use *action caching*.

``` ruby
class WidgetsController < ApplicationController

  before_filter :authenticate!
  caches_action :index

  def index
    @widgets = Widget.all
  end

end
```

Fragment Caching
----------------

Specific portions of a page can be cached with *fragment caching*.

``` erb
<% cache('all_widgets') do %>
  # ...
<% end %>
```

Sweepers
--------

Instead of adding cache expiration logic into the controller, we can *sweep* the cache by implementing an observer.

``` ruby
class WidgetSweeper < ActionController::Caching::Sweeper
  observe Widget
 
  def after_create(widget)
    expire_cache_for(widget)
  end
 
  def after_update(widget)
    expire_cache_for(widget)
  end
 
  def after_destroy(widget)
    expire_cache_for(widget)
  end
 
  private

    def expire_cache_for(widget)
      expire_page(:controller => 'widgets', :action => 'index')
      expire_fragment('all_widgets')
    end

end
```

Testing
-------

Enable caching in *config/environments/test.rb*.

``` ruby
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
```

The following controller test expects *Widget.all* to be called only the first time the page is hit.

``` ruby
it "should cache :index action" do
  Widget.should_receive(:all).once
  2.times { get :index }
end
```

We also need to clear the Rails cache between runs.

``` ruby
config.before :each do
  Rails.cache.clear
end
```
