HAML
====

[HAML](http://haml-lang.com) is, and is an acronym for, an *HTML Abstraction Markup Language*.

Haml avoids the need for explicitly coding HTML into the template, because it itself is a description of the HTML, with some code to generate dynamic content.

HTML in HAML
------------

    require 'haml'

    s = "Ruby String"

    e = Haml::Engine.new "%p Hello World"

    e.render # "<p>Hello World</p>"

Indentation matters in HAML. It allows the parser to cleverly close our tags without being explicitly told to do so. Two spaces per indent is the rule. 

* The first non-whitespace character of each line is what is used to decide how to parse the line
* HTML tags open with `%`
* HTML comments start with `/`
* Divs with an ID start with `#`
* Divs with a class start with `.`
* Doctype declaration is `!!!`

Example:

    !!!
    %html
      %head
        %title HAML Example
      %body
        / a paragraph of class intro        
        %p.intro
          An Introduction to HAML          
        / a div with id=links and class bottom
        #links.bottom
          %a{ href: "http://generalassemb.ly" } GeneralAssemb.ly
        / a div with class footer and left
        .footer.left
          built at GeneralAssemb.ly

Mixing with Ruby
----------------

Text after an `=` sign is the result of Ruby code, text after `-` evaluates Ruby code.

    %ul
      -(1..5).each do |i|
        %li= i

Binding
-------

Render accepts an *Object*, *Proc*, etc. 

    require 'haml'

    class Hound
      def initialize
        @sound = "bow wow"
      end      
      def public_binding
        binding
      end
    end

    t = %q{
    = "The dog says #{@sound}"
    }

    dog = Hound.new
    Haml::Engine.new(t).render(dog.public_binding)
